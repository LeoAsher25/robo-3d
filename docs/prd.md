# Yasuo Three.js Meme Simulator Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goal, Objective and Context

**Goal:**
Create a humorous and technically impressive 3D web experience featuring a "Yasuo in a wheelchair" meme to serve as a unique portfolio piece, demonstrating proficiency in React, Three.js, and optionally NestJS for backend extensions.

**Objective:**
For the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), the objective is to launch a web application that renders the 3D character model in a scene and allows users to trigger a set of predefined, meme-worthy animations for abilities (Q, W, E, R) and spells (F, D) via keyboard input. The application will be built with a clear, scalable structure that is easy to understand and extend.

**Context:**
The project leverages the popularity of the League of Legends character Yasuo and internet meme culture to create an engaging and shareable application. It is designed to showcase advanced front-end development skills (specifically with React and Three.js) in a more entertaining format than a standard application. The target audience includes tech recruiters, other developers, and the gaming community, so the final product must be both technically sound and highly entertaining.

## Functional Requirements (MVP)

- The application must render a 3D scene with a ground plane and basic lighting.
- A 3D model representing "Yasuo in a wheelchair" must be loaded and displayed in the scene.
- The application must capture keyboard inputs for the keys: Q, W, E, R, F, and D.
- Each key press must trigger a unique, corresponding animation or visual effect on the character model or in the scene.

## Non Functional Requirements (MVP)

- **Performance:** The application should maintain a fluid frame rate (targeting 60 FPS) on modern desktop web browsers (latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge).
- **Usability:** The experience must be immediately understandable. Controls should be simple (press a key, see an action) and responsive.
- **Entertainment:** The core focus is on humor and user enjoyment. Animations and effects should be exaggerated and "meme-worthy".

## User Interaction and Design Goals

The primary user interaction is through the keyboard. The design should be clean and simple, focusing all attention on the 3D character and their actions. The overall aesthetic is humorous and self-aware, embracing the meme culture it originates from. The camera will be a 3rd-person view that follows the character. The application is targeted for desktop web browsers.

## Technical Assumptions

This section provides high-level guidance for the Architect.

- **Repository & Service Architecture:** A **Monorepo** structure is recommended to house the React frontend and the optional NestJS backend. This simplifies dependency management and development for the MVP. The initial service architecture will be a **Monolith**, with the React Single Page Application (SPA) as the core component. An optional, co-located NestJS API can be added later without significant architectural changes.

## Epic Overview

- **Epic 1: Foundational Scene & Character Rendering**

  - **Goal:** To establish a visible, interactive character in a basic world, setting the stage for all subsequent features.
  - **Story 1.1:** As a user, I want to see a basic 3D environment so that the character has a world to exist in.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. A flat plane is rendered as the ground.
      2. Basic ambient and directional lighting is present to make the scene visible.
  - **Story 1.2:** As a user, I want to see the "Yasuo in a wheelchair" 3D model rendered in the environment so that the main character of the experience is present.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. The specified 3D model is loaded into the scene.
      2. The model is placed at the center of the ground plane.
      3. The model is correctly scaled and textured.

- **Epic 2: Core Ability Implementation**

  - **Goal:** To allow users to interact with the character and trigger his primary, well-known abilities for an engaging experience.
  - **Story 2.1:** As a user, I want to press the 'Q' key to see Yasuo perform a sword thrust action so that I can feel like I'm using his main attack.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. Pressing the 'Q' key triggers a forward-thrusting animation.
      2. The animation plays smoothly to completion.
  - **Story 2.2:** As a user, I want to press the 'W' key to see a wind wall appear in front of Yasuo so that I can use his iconic defensive ability.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. Pressing the 'W' key instantiates a semi-transparent plane object in front of the character model.
      2. The wall persists for a short duration (e.g., 3-4 seconds) and then disappears.
  - **Story 2.3:** As a user, I want to press the 'E' key to see Yasuo dash a short distance so that I can experience his signature mobility.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. Pressing the 'E' key moves the character model forward a fixed distance over a short period.
      2. A simple particle effect or trail is left behind during the dash.

- **Epic 3: Special Moves & Ultimate**
  - **Goal:** To implement the remaining abilities that complete the character's kit, adding more layers of interaction and humor.
  - **Story 3.1:** As a user, I want to press the 'F' key to see Yasuo instantly teleport a short distance so that I can use the "Flash" spell.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. Pressing the 'F' key instantly changes the character's position to a point a fixed distance in front of him.
      2. A visual "poof" or flash effect appears at the start and end locations.
  - **Story 3.2:** As a user, I want to press the 'D' key to see a humorous, custom action so that the experience is surprising and funny.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. Pressing the 'D' key triggers a non-standard animation (e.g., the character spins rapidly in the wheelchair).
  - **Story 3.3:** As a user, I want to press the 'R' key to see Yasuo perform a simplified or meme-version of his ultimate ability so that his full kit is represented.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      1. Pressing the 'R' key triggers a unique, over-the-top animation.
      2. A text bubble with a meme phrase (e.g., "GGEZ", "HASAGI!") appears above the character.

## Key Reference Documents

_{This section will be created later, from the sections prior to this being carved up into smaller documents}_

## Out of Scope Ideas Post MVP

- Sound effects for abilities and movement.
- Interactable targets (e.g., "minions" or training dummies).
- A functional NestJS backend to track user stats (e.g., total abilities used).
- A more detailed 3D environment with props and varied terrain.
- Additional meme-based features or character skins.
