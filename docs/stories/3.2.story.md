# Story 3.2: D Ability - Humorous Action

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a user
- I want to press the 'D' key to see a humorous, custom action
- so that the experience is surprising and funny

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Pressing the 'D' key triggers a non-standard animation (e.g., the character spins rapidly in the wheelchair).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Extend character state management for D ability (AC: 1)
  - [x] Update `src/stores/useCharacterStore.ts` to include D_ABILITY state
  - [x] Add humorous action animation state management
  - [x] Implement humorous action timing and cleanup logic
- [x] Task 2: Enhance keyboard input handling for D key (AC: 1)
  - [x] Update `src/hooks/useKeyboardControls.ts` to handle D key press
  - [x] Add D key detection with cooldown prevention
  - [x] Connect D key events to character store actions
- [x] Task 3: Update Character component for humorous animation (AC: 1)
  - [x] Enhance `src/components/3d/Character.tsx` to handle humorous action
  - [x] Implement rapid spinning animation for wheelchair
  - [x] Add humorous action timing and visual effects
- [x] Task 4: Add visual effects and testing (AC: 1)
  - [x] Implement rapid spinning animation with smooth rotation
  - [x] Add visual feedback during humorous action
  - [x] Test humorous action timing and animation smoothness

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Core Technologies Required

- **Zustand** for state management (see `docs/front-end-state-management.md`)
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** with `@react-three/drei` for 3D animations (see `docs/3d-ecosystem.md`)
- **TypeScript 5.x** for type safety (see `docs/coding-standards.md`)
- **React hooks** for keyboard input handling and animation timing

### Component Architecture

- **Character Component**: Enhanced to handle humorous action animations (see `docs/component-view.md`)
- **useCharacterStore**: Extended Zustand store for humorous action state management
- **useKeyboardControls**: Enhanced keyboard hook for D key handling
- **SceneContainer**: Updated to support humorous action animations

### Project Structure Alignment

- Character component updates in `src/components/3d/Character.tsx` (see `docs/project-structure.md`)
- Follow existing component patterns from previous ability implementations
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions for `src/app/` structure

### Key Implementation Details

- **State Management**: Extend Zustand store with humorous action states (`D_ABILITY`, `HUMOROUS_ACTIVE`)
- **Animation System**: Rapid spinning animation for wheelchair character
- **Visual Effects**: Smooth rotation with visual feedback
- **Timing**: 1-2 second humorous action duration with smooth easing

### Extended Character Store Structure

```typescript
interface CharacterState {
  position: [number, number, number];
  action: string | null; // 'Q_ATTACK', 'W_ABILITY', 'E_ABILITY', 'F_ABILITY', 'D_ABILITY', 'IDLE'
  isAnimating: boolean;
  animationProgress: number;
  animationDuration: number;
  windWallActive: boolean;
  windWallStartTime: number;
  windWallDuration: number;
  dashActive: boolean;
  dashStartPosition: [number, number, number];
  dashTargetPosition: [number, number, number];
  dashStartTime: number;
  dashDuration: number;
  flashActive: boolean;
  flashStartPosition: [number, number, number];
  flashEndPosition: [number, number, number];
  flashStartTime: number;
  flashDuration: number;
  humorousActive: boolean;
  humorousStartTime: number;
  humorousDuration: number;
  setAction: (action: string | null) => void;
  setAnimationProgress: (progress: number) => void;
  setAnimationDuration: (duration: number) => void;
  resetAnimation: () => void;
  setPosition: (position: [number, number, number]) => void;
  activateWindWall: () => void;
  deactivateWindWall: () => void;
  activateDash: () => void;
  deactivateDash: () => void;
  activateFlash: () => void;
  deactivateFlash: () => void;
  activateHumorous: () => void;
  deactivateHumorous: () => void;
}
```

### Humorous Action Implementation

- **Animation Type**: Rapid spinning animation for wheelchair character
- **Duration**: 1-2 seconds with smooth easing
- **Visual Style**: Character spins rapidly in wheelchair with visual feedback
- **Rotation Speed**: Multiple full rotations during animation duration

### Animation Implementation

- **Spinning Animation**: Character group rotates rapidly around Y-axis
- **Visual Feedback**: Color changes or effects during spinning
- **Smooth Easing**: Ease-in-out for natural spinning motion
- **Rotation Count**: 3-5 full rotations during animation

### Input Handling

- **Keyboard Events**: Listen for 'D' key press and release
- **Event Prevention**: Prevent default browser behavior for game keys
- **State Updates**: Update character store action state on key press
- **Cooldown**: Prevent rapid-fire D presses during humorous action

### Coding Standards

- Follow PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions (see `docs/coding-standards.md`)
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all state and props
- Implement proper error boundaries for 3D animation handling (see `docs/error-handling.md`)

### Component Integration

- Character component handles spinning animation during humorous action
- Keyboard hook updates store on D key events
- Proper cleanup and timing management
- Visual feedback during animation

### Testing Approach

- Unit tests for keyboard hook functionality (see `docs/testing-strategy.md`)
- Manual testing on Chrome, Firefox, Edge for key responsiveness
- Test humorous action timing, animation smoothness, and visual effects
- Verify state management and cleanup

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize spinning animation for smooth performance
- Use efficient rotation calculations
- Implement proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Monitor performance during humorous action animations
