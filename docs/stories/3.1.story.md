# Story 3.1: F Ability - Flash Teleport

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a user
- I want to press the 'F' key to see Yasuo instantly teleport a short distance
- so that I can use the "Flash" spell

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Pressing the 'F' key instantly changes the character's position to a point a fixed distance in front of him.
2. A visual "poof" or flash effect appears at the start and end locations.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Core Technologies Required

- **Zustand** for state management (see `docs/front-end-state-management.md`)
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** with `@react-three/drei` for 3D effects and lighting (see `docs/3d-ecosystem.md`)
- **TypeScript 5.x** for type safety (see `docs/coding-standards.md`)
- **React hooks** for keyboard input handling and effect timing

### Component Architecture

- **FlashEffect Component**: New component for flash teleport visual effects (see `docs/component-view.md`)
- **useCharacterStore**: Extended Zustand store for flash teleport state management
- **useKeyboardControls**: Enhanced keyboard hook for F key handling
- **Character Component**: Updated to handle instant teleport movement
- **SceneContainer**: Updated to include FlashEffect component

### Project Structure Alignment

- FlashEffect component should be placed in `src/components/3d/FlashEffect.tsx` (see `docs/project-structure.md`)
- Follow existing component patterns from Character and WindWall components
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions for `src/app/` structure

### Key Implementation Details

- **State Management**: Extend Zustand store with flash states (`F_ABILITY`, `FLASH_ACTIVE`)
- **Teleport System**: Instant position change without interpolation
- **Flash Effects**: Particle effects and light at start/end locations
- **Timing**: Instant teleport with flash effects lasting 0.5-1 second

### Extended Character Store Structure

```typescript
interface CharacterState {
  position: [number, number, number];
  action: string | null; // 'Q_ATTACK', 'W_ABILITY', 'E_ABILITY', 'F_ABILITY', 'IDLE'
  isAnimating: boolean;
  animationProgress: number;
  animationDuration: number;
  windWallActive: boolean;
  windWallStartTime: number;
  windWallDuration: number;
  dashActive: boolean;
  dashStartPosition: [number, number, number];
  dashTargetPosition: [number, number, number];
  dashStartTime: number;
  dashDuration: number;
  flashActive: boolean;
  flashStartPosition: [number, number, number];
  flashEndPosition: [number, number, number];
  flashStartTime: number;
  flashDuration: number;
  setAction: (action: string | null) => void;
  setAnimationProgress: (progress: number) => void;
  setAnimationDuration: (duration: number) => void;
  resetAnimation: () => void;
  setPosition: (position: [number, number, number]) => void;
  activateWindWall: () => void;
  deactivateWindWall: () => void;
  activateDash: () => void;
  deactivateDash: () => void;
  activateFlash: () => void;
  deactivateFlash: () => void;
}
```

### Flash Teleport Implementation

- **Teleport Distance**: Fixed distance forward (e.g., 4-5 units)
- **Movement Type**: Instant position change (no interpolation)
- **Direction**: Forward in the direction the character is facing (positive Z-axis)
- **Effect Duration**: Flash effects last 0.5-1 second

### Flash Effects Implementation

- **Start Effect**: "Poof" effect at original position with particles and light
- **End Effect**: "Poof" effect at destination with particles and light
- **Visual Style**: Bright flash with particles, light intensity, and fade effects
- **Particle System**: Burst of particles at both start and end locations

### Input Handling

- **Keyboard Events**: Listen for 'F' key press and release
- **Event Prevention**: Prevent default browser behavior for game keys
- **State Updates**: Update character store action state on key press
- **Cooldown**: Prevent rapid-fire F presses during flash effects

### Coding Standards

- Follow PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions (see `docs/coding-standards.md`)
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all state and props
- Implement proper error boundaries for 3D effect handling (see `docs/error-handling.md`)

### Component Integration

- Character component handles instant position change during flash
- FlashEffect component creates visual effects at start/end positions
- Keyboard hook updates store on F key events
- SceneContainer conditionally renders FlashEffect based on state
- Proper cleanup and effect timing management

### Testing Approach

- Unit tests for keyboard hook functionality (see `docs/testing-strategy.md`)
- Manual testing on Chrome, Firefox, Edge for key responsiveness
- Test flash teleport timing, distance, and visual effects
- Verify state management and cleanup

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize flash effects for smooth performance
- Use efficient particle systems for flash effects
- Implement proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Monitor performance during flash teleport and effects
