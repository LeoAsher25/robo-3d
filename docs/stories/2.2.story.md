# Story 2.2: W Ability - Wind Wall

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a user
- I want to press the 'W' key to see a wind wall appear in front of Yasuo
- so that I can use his iconic defensive ability

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Pressing the 'W' key instantiates a semi-transparent plane object in front of the character model.
2. The wall persists for a short duration (e.g., 3-4 seconds) and then disappears.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Extend character state management for W ability (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Update `src/stores/useCharacterStore.ts` to include W_ABILITY state
  - [x] Add wind wall duration tracking and cleanup logic
  - [x] Implement wind wall visibility state management
- [x] Task 2: Enhance keyboard input handling for W key (AC: 1)
  - [x] Update `src/hooks/useKeyboardControls.ts` to handle W key press
  - [x] Add W key detection with cooldown prevention
  - [x] Connect W key events to character store actions
- [x] Task 3: Create WindWall component (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create `src/components/3d/WindWall.tsx`
  - [x] Implement semi-transparent plane with wind-like material
  - [x] Add positioning logic to appear in front of character
- [x] Task 4: Integrate WindWall into scene (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Update `src/components/3d/SceneContainer.tsx` to include WindWall
  - [x] Implement conditional rendering based on wind wall state
  - [x] Add proper cleanup and timing management
- [x] Task 5: Add visual effects and testing (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Implement wind-like visual effects (particles, transparency)
  - [x] Add fade in/out animations for wall appearance/disappearance
  - [x] Test wind wall timing and positioning

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Core Technologies Required

- **Zustand** for state management (see `docs/front-end-state-management.md`)
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** with `@react-three/drei` for 3D objects (see `docs/3d-ecosystem.md`)
- **TypeScript 5.x** for type safety (see `docs/coding-standards.md`)
- **React hooks** for keyboard input handling and timing

### Component Architecture

- **WindWall Component**: New component for wind wall visualization (see `docs/component-view.md`)
- **useCharacterStore**: Extended Zustand store for wind wall state management
- **useKeyboardControls**: Enhanced keyboard hook for W key handling
- **SceneContainer**: Updated to include WindWall component

### Project Structure Alignment

- WindWall component should be placed in `src/components/3d/WindWall.tsx` (see `docs/project-structure.md`)
- Follow existing component patterns from Character and Environment components
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions for `src/app/` structure

### Key Implementation Details

- **State Management**: Extend Zustand store with wind wall states (`W_ABILITY`, `WIND_WALL_ACTIVE`)
- **Wind Wall Object**: Semi-transparent plane with wind-like material and effects
- **Positioning**: Position wall in front of character at fixed distance
- **Timing**: 3-4 second duration with fade in/out animations

### Extended Character Store Structure

```typescript
interface CharacterState {
  position: [number, number, number];
  action: string | null; // 'Q_ATTACK', 'W_ABILITY', 'IDLE'
  isAnimating: boolean;
  animationProgress: number;
  windWallActive: boolean;
  windWallStartTime: number;
  windWallDuration: number;
  setAction: (action: string | null) => void;
  setAnimationProgress: (progress: number) => void;
  activateWindWall: () => void;
  deactivateWindWall: () => void;
  resetAnimation: () => void;
}
```

### Wind Wall Implementation

- **Visual Design**: Semi-transparent plane with wind-like texture/material
- **Positioning**: Fixed distance in front of character (e.g., 2-3 units)
- **Duration**: 3-4 seconds with automatic cleanup
- **Effects**: Fade in/out animations, wind-like particle effects
- **Material**: Transparent material with wind-like appearance

### Input Handling

- **Keyboard Events**: Listen for 'W' key press and release
- **Event Prevention**: Prevent default browser behavior for game keys
- **State Updates**: Update character store action state on key press
- **Cooldown**: Prevent rapid-fire W presses during wind wall duration

### Coding Standards

- Follow PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions (see `docs/coding-standards.md`)
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all state and props
- Implement proper error boundaries for 3D object handling (see `docs/error-handling.md`)

### Component Integration

- WindWall component listens to store state changes
- Keyboard hook updates store on W key events
- SceneContainer conditionally renders WindWall based on state
- Proper cleanup and timing management

### Testing Approach

- Unit tests for keyboard hook functionality (see `docs/testing-strategy.md`)
- Manual testing on Chrome, Firefox, Edge for key responsiveness
- Test wind wall timing, positioning, and visual effects
- Verify state management and cleanup

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize wind wall rendering for smooth performance
- Use efficient material and geometry for wind wall object
- Implement proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Monitor performance during wind wall effects

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude Sonnet 4`
