## Dev Technical Guidance

### Core Technologies Required

- **Zustand** for state management (see `docs/front-end-state-management.md`)
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** with `@react-three/drei` for 3D effects and text (see `docs/3d-ecosystem.md`)
- **TypeScript 5.x** for type safety (see `docs/coding-standards.md`)
- **React hooks** for keyboard input handling and animation timing

### Component Architecture

- **UltimateTextBubble Component**: New component for meme text display (see `docs/component-view.md`)
- **Character Component**: Enhanced to handle ultimate action animations
- **useCharacterStore**: Extended Zustand store for ultimate action state management
- **useKeyboardControls**: Enhanced keyboard hook for R key handling
- **SceneContainer**: Updated to include UltimateTextBubble component

### Project Structure Alignment

- UltimateTextBubble component should be placed in `src/components/3d/UltimateTextBubble.tsx` (see `docs/project-structure.md`)
- Follow existing component patterns from previous ability implementations
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions for `src/app/` structure

### Key Implementation Details

- **State Management**: Extend Zustand store with ultimate action states (`R_ABILITY`, `ULTIMATE_ACTIVE`, `TEXT_BUBBLE_ACTIVE`)
- **Animation System**: Over-the-top dramatic animation for ultimate ability
- **Text Bubble**: Meme phrases with positioning and timing
- **Timing**: 2-3 second ultimate action duration with dramatic effects

### Extended Character Store Structure

```typescript
interface CharacterState {
  position: [number, number, number];
  action: string | null; // 'Q_ATTACK', 'W_ABILITY', 'E_ABILITY', 'F_ABILITY', 'D_ABILITY', 'R_ABILITY', 'IDLE'
  isAnimating: boolean;
  animationProgress: number;
  animationDuration: number;
  windWallActive: boolean;
  windWallStartTime: number;
  windWallDuration: number;
  dashActive: boolean;
  dashStartPosition: [number, number, number];
  dashTargetPosition: [number, number, number];
  dashStartTime: number;
  dashDuration: number;
  flashActive: boolean;
  flashStartPosition: [number, number, number];
  flashEndPosition: [number, number, number];
  flashStartTime: number;
  flashDuration: number;
  humorousActive: boolean;
  humorousStartTime: number;
  humorousDuration: number;
  ultimateActive: boolean;
  ultimateStartTime: number;
  ultimateDuration: number;
  textBubbleActive: boolean;
  textBubbleText: string;
  textBubbleStartTime: number;
  textBubbleDuration: number;
  setAction: (action: string | null) => void;
  setAnimationProgress: (progress: number) => void;
  setAnimationDuration: (duration: number) => void;
  resetAnimation: () => void;
  setPosition: (position: [number, number, number]) => void;
  activateWindWall: () => void;
  deactivateWindWall: () => void;
  activateDash: () => void;
  deactivateDash: () => void;
  activateFlash: () => void;
  deactivateFlash: () => void;
  activateHumorous: () => void;
  deactivateHumorous: () => void;
  activateUltimate: () => void;
  deactivateUltimate: () => void;
}
```

### Ultimate Action Implementation

- **Animation Type**: Over-the-top dramatic animation for ultimate ability
- **Duration**: 2-3 seconds with dramatic effects
- **Visual Style**: Character performs dramatic ultimate animation with effects
- **Animation Phases**: Wind-up, execution, and recovery phases

### Text Bubble Implementation

- **Meme Phrases**: Array of phrases like "GGEZ", "HASAGI!", "YASUO MAIN BTW"
- **Positioning**: Appears above character during ultimate animation
- **Timing**: Shows during ultimate action with fade in/out effects
- **Visual Style**: Speech bubble with meme text and styling

### Animation Implementation

- **Ultimate Animation**: Dramatic character movement with multiple phases
- **Visual Effects**: Particle effects, color changes, and dramatic lighting
- **Smooth Easing**: Ease-in-out for natural dramatic motion
- **Animation Phases**: Wind-up, execution, recovery with different effects

### Input Handling

- **Keyboard Events**: Listen for 'R' key press and release
- **Event Prevention**: Prevent default browser behavior for game keys
- **State Updates**: Update character store action state on key press
- **Cooldown**: Prevent rapid-fire R presses during ultimate action

### Coding Standards

- Follow PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions (see `docs/coding-standards.md`)
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all state and props
- Implement proper error boundaries for 3D effect handling (see `docs/error-handling.md`)

### Component Integration

- Character component handles ultimate animation during ultimate action
- UltimateTextBubble component displays meme phrases above character
- Keyboard hook updates store on R key events
- SceneContainer conditionally renders UltimateTextBubble based on state
- Proper cleanup and effect timing management

### Testing Approach

- Unit tests for keyboard hook functionality (see `docs/testing-strategy.md`)
- Manual testing on Chrome, Firefox, Edge for key responsiveness
- Test ultimate timing, animation, and text bubble display
- Verify state management and cleanup

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize ultimate animation for smooth performance
- Use efficient text rendering for text bubbles
- Implement proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Monitor performance during ultimate action and text effects
