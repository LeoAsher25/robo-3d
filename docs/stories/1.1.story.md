# Story 1.1: Basic 3D Environment

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a user
- I want to see a basic 3D environment
- so that the character has a world to exist in

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. A flat plane is rendered as the ground.
2. Basic ambient and directional lighting is present to make the scene visible.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Set up basic Next.js project structure (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create Next.js project with TypeScript
  - [x] Install required dependencies (@react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, three)
  - [x] Set up project structure according to `docs/project-structure.md`
- [x] Task 2: Create SceneContainer component (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create `src/components/3d/SceneContainer.tsx`
  - [x] Implement R3F Canvas wrapper
  - [x] Add basic camera setup
- [x] Task 3: Create Environment component (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create `src/components/3d/Environment.tsx`
  - [x] Implement ground plane using R3F
  - [x] Add ambient lighting
  - [x] Add directional lighting
- [x] Task 4: Integrate components in main page (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Update `src/app/page.tsx` to use SceneContainer
  - [x] Ensure proper component hierarchy
  - [x] Test basic 3D scene rendering

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Core Technologies Required

- **Next.js 14+** with App Router (see `docs/core-technologies.md`)
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** for Three.js integration (see `docs/3d-ecosystem.md`)
- **TypeScript 5.x** for type safety (see `docs/coding-standards.md`)

### Component Architecture

- **SceneContainer**: Main wrapper component containing R3F Canvas (see `docs/component-view.md`)
- **Environment**: Responsible for 3D environment setup including lighting and ground (see `docs/component-view.md`)

### Project Structure Alignment

- Components should be placed in `src/components/3d/` (see `docs/project-structure.md`)
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions for `src/app/` structure
- Use TypeScript throughout (see `docs/coding-standards.md`)

### Key Implementation Details

- **Ground Plane**: Use R3F's `<mesh>` with plane geometry for the ground
- **Lighting**: Implement both ambient and directional lights using R3F's `<ambientLight>` and `<directionalLight>`
- **Camera**: Set up a basic perspective camera with appropriate position and field of view
- **Canvas Setup**: Use R3F's `<Canvas>` component as the main 3D renderer

### Coding Standards

- Follow PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions (see `docs/coding-standards.md`)
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props
- Implement proper error boundaries for 3D rendering (see `docs/error-handling.md`)

### Testing Approach

- Unit tests for component rendering (see `docs/testing-strategy.md`)
- Manual testing on Chrome, Firefox, Edge (see `docs/testing-strategy.md`)
- Focus on visual verification of 3D scene elements

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude Sonnet 4`

### Completion Notes List

- Successfully set up Next.js 15.4.2 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Installed and configured React Three Fiber ecosystem (@react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, three)
- Created proper project structure following the architecture guidelines
- Implemented SceneContainer with R3F Canvas and camera setup
- Created Environment component with ground plane and lighting (ambient + directional)
- Fixed Tailwind CSS PostCSS configuration for Next.js 15 compatibility
- Build and development server working successfully
- All acceptance criteria met: ground plane rendered and lighting present
