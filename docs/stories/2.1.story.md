# Story 2.1: Q Ability - Sword Thrust

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a user
- I want to press the 'Q' key to see Yasuo perform a sword thrust action
- so that I can feel like I'm using his main attack

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Pressing the 'Q' key triggers a forward-thrusting animation.
2. The animation plays smoothly to completion.

- [x] Task 2: Implement keyboard input handling (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `src/hooks/useKeyboardControls.ts`
  - [x] Set up event listeners for 'Q' key press
  - [x] Connect keyboard events to character store actions
- [x] Task 3: Create animation system for Character component (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Update `src/components/3d/Character.tsx` to handle animations
  - [x] Implement sword thrust animation using Three.js transformations
  - [x] Add animation completion callbacks
- [x] Task 4: Integrate input and animation systems (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Connect keyboard input to character animations
  - [x] Ensure smooth animation playback from start to finish
  - [x] Add proper state management for animation timing
- [x] Task 5: Add visual feedback and testing (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Implement visual feedback during Q animation
  - [x] Add animation state debugging/logging
  - [x] Test animation smoothness and completion

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Core Technologies Required

- **Zustand** for state management (see `docs/front-end-state-management.md`)
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** with `@react-three/drei` for animations (see `docs/3d-ecosystem.md`)
- **TypeScript 5.x** for type safety (see `docs/coding-standards.md`)
- **React hooks** for keyboard input handling

### Component Architecture

- **Character Component**: Enhanced to handle animations and state changes (see `docs/component-view.md`)
- **useCharacterStore**: Zustand store for character state management (see `docs/front-end-state-management.md`)
- **useKeyboardControls**: Custom hook for keyboard input handling

### Project Structure Alignment

- Store should be placed in `src/stores/useCharacterStore.ts` (see `docs/project-structure.md`)
- Hook should be placed in `src/hooks/useKeyboardControls.ts` (see `docs/project-structure.md`)
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions for `src/app/` structure

### Key Implementation Details

- **State Management**: Use Zustand store with action state (`Q_ATTACK`, `IDLE`)
- **Animation System**: Implement sword thrust using Three.js transformations (rotation, position)
- **Input Handling**: Use `useEffect` with `addEventListener` for keyboard events
- **Animation Timing**: Use `useFrame` from R3F for smooth animation loops

### Character Store Structure

```typescript
interface CharacterState {
  position: [number, number, number];
  action: string | null; // 'Q_ATTACK', 'IDLE'
  isAnimating: boolean;
  animationProgress: number;
  setAction: (action: string | null) => void;
  setAnimationProgress: (progress: number) => void;
  resetAnimation: () => void;
}
```

### Animation Implementation

- **Sword Thrust Animation**:
  - Rotate character's arm forward and back
  - Add slight forward movement during thrust
  - Duration: ~0.5-1 second
  - Smooth easing for natural motion
- **Animation States**: IDLE → Q_ATTACK → IDLE
- **Progress Tracking**: 0.0 to 1.0 for animation completion

### Input Handling

- **Keyboard Events**: Listen for 'Q' key press and release
- **Event Prevention**: Prevent default browser behavior for game keys
- **State Updates**: Update character store action state on key press
- **Cooldown**: Prevent rapid-fire Q presses during animation

### Coding Standards

- Follow PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions (see `docs/coding-standards.md`)
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all state and props
- Implement proper error boundaries for animation handling (see `docs/error-handling.md`)

### Component Integration

- Character component listens to store state changes
- Keyboard hook updates store on key events
- Animation system responds to action state changes
- Proper cleanup of event listeners

### Testing Approach

- Unit tests for keyboard hook functionality (see `docs/testing-strategy.md`)
- Manual testing on Chrome, Firefox, Edge for key responsiveness
- Test animation smoothness and completion timing
- Verify state management and cleanup

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize animation frame rate for smooth playback
- Use `useFrame` efficiently to avoid unnecessary renders
- Implement proper cleanup for event listeners
- Monitor memory usage during animation cycles

## Story Progress Notes
