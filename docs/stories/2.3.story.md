# Story 2.3: E Ability - Dash

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a user
- I want to press the 'E' key to see Yasuo dash a short distance
- so that I can experience his signature mobility

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Pressing the 'E' key moves the character model forward a fixed distance over a short period.
2. A simple particle effect or trail is left behind during the dash.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Core Technologies Required

- **Zustand** for state management (see `docs/front-end-state-management.md`)
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** with `@react-three/drei` for 3D movement and particles (see `docs/3d-ecosystem.md`)
- **TypeScript 5.x** for type safety (see `docs/coding-standards.md`)
- **React hooks** for keyboard input handling and movement timing

### Component Architecture

- **DashTrail Component**: New component for particle trail effects (see `docs/component-view.md`)
- **useCharacterStore**: Extended Zustand store for dash movement state management
- **useKeyboardControls**: Enhanced keyboard hook for E key handling
- **Character Component**: Updated to handle dash movement and position interpolation
- **SceneContainer**: Updated to include DashTrail component

### Project Structure Alignment

- DashTrail component should be placed in `src/components/3d/DashTrail.tsx` (see `docs/project-structure.md`)
- Follow existing component patterns from Character and WindWall components
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions for `src/app/` structure

### Key Implementation Details

- **State Management**: Extend Zustand store with dash states (`E_ABILITY`, `DASH_ACTIVE`)
- **Movement System**: Smooth position interpolation from start to target position
- **Trail Effects**: Particle system that follows dash movement
- **Timing**: 0.5-1 second dash duration with smooth easing

### Extended Character Store Structure

```typescript
interface CharacterState {
  position: [number, number, number];
  action: string | null; // 'Q_ATTACK', 'W_ABILITY', 'E_ABILITY', 'IDLE'
  isAnimating: boolean;
  animationProgress: number;
  animationDuration: number;
  windWallActive: boolean;
  windWallStartTime: number;
  windWallDuration: number;
  dashActive: boolean;
  dashStartPosition: [number, number, number];
  dashTargetPosition: [number, number, number];
  dashStartTime: number;
  dashDuration: number;
  setAction: (action: string | null) => void;
  setAnimationProgress: (progress: number) => void;
  setAnimationDuration: (duration: number) => void;
  resetAnimation: () => void;
  setPosition: (position: [number, number, number]) => void;
  activateWindWall: () => void;
  deactivateWindWall: () => void;
  activateDash: () => void;
  deactivateDash: () => void;
}
```

### Dash Movement Implementation

- **Movement Distance**: Fixed distance forward (e.g., 3-4 units)
- **Duration**: 0.5-1 second with smooth easing
- **Interpolation**: Linear or ease-in-out interpolation between start and target positions
- **Direction**: Forward in the direction the character is facing (positive Z-axis)

### Trail Effects Implementation

- **Particle System**: Simple particles that appear at character's previous positions
- **Trail Duration**: Particles fade out over 1-2 seconds
- **Particle Count**: 10-20 particles per dash
- **Visual Style**: Wind-like particles with transparency and fade effects

### Input Handling

- **Keyboard Events**: Listen for 'E' key press and release
- **Event Prevention**: Prevent default browser behavior for game keys
- **State Updates**: Update character store action state on key press
- **Cooldown**: Prevent rapid-fire E presses during dash movement

### Coding Standards

- Follow PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions (see `docs/coding-standards.md`)
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all state and props
- Implement proper error boundaries for 3D movement handling (see `docs/error-handling.md`)

### Component Integration

- Character component handles position interpolation during dash
- DashTrail component creates particles at previous positions
- Keyboard hook updates store on E key events
- SceneContainer conditionally renders DashTrail based on state
- Proper cleanup and timing management

### Testing Approach

- Unit tests for keyboard hook functionality (see `docs/testing-strategy.md`)
- Manual testing on Chrome, Firefox, Edge for key responsiveness
- Test dash movement timing, distance, and trail effects
- Verify state management and cleanup

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize particle system for smooth performance
- Use efficient interpolation for position updates
- Implement proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Monitor performance during dash movement and trail effects
