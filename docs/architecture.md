# CashCanvas Architecture Document

## Introduction / Preamble

This document outlines the overall project architecture for **CashCanvas**, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.
**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
A separate Frontend Architecture Document details the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein are definitive for the entire project.

## Technical Summary

The CashCanvas system is designed as a **monorepo** containing a **monolithic backend API** built with **NestJS** and a **cross-platform mobile application** built with **React Native**. The architecture prioritizes a clear separation of concerns, scalability, and a streamlined developer experience by using TypeScript across the entire stack. Data will be persisted in a **PostgreSQL** database. This approach provides a robust and efficient foundation for the MVP while allowing for future expansion.

---

## High-Level Overview

The architecture is a classic client-server model. The React Native mobile app acts as the client, communicating with the NestJS backend via a RESTful API. The backend handles all business logic, data persistence, and authentication. The project will be housed in a single monorepo to simplify dependency management and sharing of types and validation logic between the frontend and backend.

    Rel(user, mobileApp, "Uses")
    Rel(mobileApp, backendApi, "Makes API calls to", "HTTPS/JSON")
    Rel(backendApi, database, "Reads/Writes to", "SQL")
```

## Architectural / Design Patterns Adopted

- **Monorepo:** To manage frontend and backend code in a single repository, simplifying dependency management and code sharing (e.g., types).
- **Monolithic API:** For the MVP, a single backend service simplifies development and deployment. It can be broken down into microservices later if required.
- **Repository Pattern:** To abstract the data layer, making it easier to switch database technologies and simplifying testing.
- **Dependency Injection:** Leveraged heavily by the NestJS framework to manage dependencies and promote modular, testable code.

---

## Component View

The system consists of three major logical components: the mobile application, the backend API, and the database.

- **Mobile Application (React Native):** Responsible for all user interface rendering and user interaction. It is a "dumb" client that consumes the backend API for all data and business logic.
- **Backend API (NestJS):** The core of the system. It handles user authentication, transaction processing, data validation, and all business logic. It exposes a RESTful API for the mobile client.
- **Database (PostgreSQL):** The persistence layer. It stores all user data, transactions, goals, and other application data.

## Project Structure

The project will use a monorepo structure managed by `pnpm` or `npm/yarn workspaces`.

## Infrastructure and Deployment Overview

- **Cloud Provider(s):** AWS
- **Core Services Used:** Amazon RDS (for PostgreSQL), AWS Fargate/ECS (for NestJS container), Amazon S3 (for static assets), AWS CodePipeline/CodeBuild (if not using GitHub Actions exclusively).
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** AWS CDK. Code located in `/infra` directory.
- **Deployment Strategy:** CI/CD pipeline triggered on push to `main` branch. The pipeline will build, test, and deploy the backend container to Fargate. Mobile releases will be managed via Fastlane and uploaded to App Store Connect / Google Play Console.
- **Rollback Strategy:** Automated rollback on health check failure post-deployment for the backend. App store releases are rolled back manually.

---

## Coding Standards

- **Style Guide & Linter:** ESLint with a shared preset in `packages/config`, plus Prettier for automatic formatting.
- **Naming Conventions:** `camelCase` for variables/functions, `PascalCase` for classes/types/components.
- **File Structure:** Adhere to the layout defined in the "Project Structure" section.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Always use `async`/`await`.
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript strict mode must be enabled. The `any` type is forbidden.

---

## Overall Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** To test individual functions and services in isolation. All business logic in NestJS services must be unit tested.
- **Integration Tests:** To test the interaction between API endpoints and the database. A test database will be spun up via Docker for these tests.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** To validate complete user flows using Detox, simulating real user interaction on the mobile app.

---

## Security Best Practices

- **Input Sanitization/Validation:** NestJS `class-validator` and `class-transformer` will be used for all DTOs at the API boundary.
- **Secrets Management:** Environment variables will be used for secrets, injected via the runtime environment (ECS Task Definition, local `.env` file). Never hardcode secrets.
- **Authentication/Authorization Checks:** JWTs will be validated by a Passport.js guard in NestJS on all protected endpoints.
- **Dependency Security:** Run `npm audit` or use `pnpm audit` in CI to check for vulnerable dependencies.
