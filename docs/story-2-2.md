# Story 2.2: W Ability - Wind Wall

> This document is a granulated shard from the main "Epic 2: Core Ability Implementation" focusing on "W Ability - Wind Wall".

**Epic:** Epic 2: Core Ability Implementation

**Story:** As a user, I want to press the 'W' key to see a wind wall appear in front of Yasuo so that I can use his iconic defensive ability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Pressing the 'W' key instantiates a semi-transparent plane object in front of the character model.
2. The wall persists for a short duration (e.g., 3-4 seconds) and then disappears.
