# Project Brief: 3D Robot Simulation and Control System

## Introduction / Problem Statement

The project aims to develop a sophisticated platform for simulating and controlling robotic systems within a dynamic 3D environment. The core problem this addresses is the high cost, risk, and time consumption associated with testing and validating robotics control logic on physical hardware. By creating a real-time, web-based simulation, we can provide an accessible, efficient, and safe environment for development, testing, and visualization before physical deployment.

## Vision & Goals

- **Vision:** To create a premier, web-accessible 3D robotics simulation platform that accelerates development, facilitates remote collaboration, and serves as a powerful tool for both professional engineers and educators in Vietnam and beyond.
- **Primary Goals (MVP):**

  1.  Successfully develop a web-based 3D visualization environment using **Three.js** that can render at least one standard robot model.
  2.  Implement a responsive and intuitive control interface using **ReactJS** that allows users to send commands to the robot in real-time.
  3.  Build a robust **NodeJS** backend capable of processing control logic and updating the robot's state, which is then reflected instantly in the 3D visualization.
  4.  Deliver a functional, end-to-end prototype encompassing these core technologies within the **3-month** project timeline.

- **Success Metrics (Initial Ideas):**
  - Achieve real-time visualization of robot movements with a command-to-response latency of under 200ms.
  - The core technical team in **Hà Nội** can successfully use the platform for their development and testing workflows.
  - The MVP is deployed and operational within the 3-month timeframe.

## Target Audience / Users

- **Primary Users:** The core robotics engineers and developers within the Hà Nội-based team who will use this for daily development and validation.
- **Secondary Users:** Control systems researchers, students in robotics and computer science, and technical managers overseeing robotics projects.

## Key Features / Scope (High-Level Ideas for MVP)

- A 3D scene renderer for the environment.
- Ability to import and display a standard 3D robot model (e.g., a 6-axis robotic arm in GLTF format).
- A simple, interactive UI with controls (e.g., sliders, input fields) to manipulate the robot's joints.
- Real-time, bidirectional communication between the ReactJS frontend and NodeJS backend, likely using WebSockets.
- A backend service that interprets control commands and calculates the robot's resulting state (kinematics).

## Post MVP Features / Scope and Ideas

- Integration of a physics engine for realistic simulation (e.g., gravity, collision detection).
- Support for importing and managing multiple robot models and different 3D environments.
- Functionality to save, load, and replay simulation sessions.
- Potential integration with ROS (Robot Operating System) to bridge the gap between simulation and physical hardware.
- Multi-user collaborative environments where several users can interact with the same simulation.

## Known Technical Constraints or Preferences

- **Constraints:**
  - A strict **3-month** development and deployment timeline.
  - The project must be built around the core team based in **Hà Nội**.
- **Initial Architectural Preferences (if any):**
  - A **monorepo** structure seems highly suitable to manage the tightly coupled frontend, backend, and shared simulation logic.
  - [cite_start]For the MVP, a **monolithic backend** architecture is recommended to simplify development and meet the tight deadline, with the possibility of refactoring to microservices post-MVP. [cite: 814]
- **Risks:**
  - The 3-month timeline is highly ambitious for developing a 3D simulation platform from the ground up and poses a significant risk.
  - The team's existing expertise with Three.js and real-time 3D web development will be a critical factor and a potential bottleneck.
  - Ensuring high performance and low latency for the real-time interaction loop can be technically challenging.
- **User Preferences:**
  - The technology stack is fixed: **ReactJS** (frontend), **Three.js** (visualization), and **NodeJS** (backend).
  - The primary focus is on achieving a smooth, **real-time** control and visualization experience.
