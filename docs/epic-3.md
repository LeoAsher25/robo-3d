# Epic 3: Special Moves & Ultimate

> This document is a granulated shard from the main "Yasuo Three.js Meme Simulator Product Requirements Document (PRD)" focusing on "Special Moves & Ultimate".

**Goal:** To implement the remaining abilities that complete the character's kit, adding more layers of interaction and humor.

**Story 3.1:** As a user, I want to press the 'F' key to see Yasuo instantly teleport a short distance so that I can use the "Flash" spell.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Pressing the 'F' key instantly changes the character's position to a point a fixed distance in front of him.
  2. A visual "poof" or flash effect appears at the start and end locations.

**Story 3.2:** As a user, I want to press the 'D' key to see a humorous, custom action so that the experience is surprising and funny.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Pressing the 'D' key triggers a non-standard animation (e.g., the character spins rapidly in the wheelchair).

**Story 3.3:** As a user, I want to press the 'R' key to see Yasuo perform a simplified or meme-version of his ultimate ability so that his full kit is represented.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Pressing the 'R' key triggers a unique, over-the-top animation.
  2. A text bubble with a meme phrase (e.g., "GGEZ", "HASAGI!") appears above the character.
