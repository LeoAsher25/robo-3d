**Epic:** Epic 2: Core Ability Implementation

**Story:** As a user, I want to press the 'E' key to see Yasuo dash a short distance so that I can experience his signature mobility.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Pressing the 'E' key moves the character model forward a fixed distance over a short period.
2. A simple particle effect or trail is left behind during the dash.
