# Epic 1: Foundational Scene & Character Rendering

> This document is a granulated shard from the main "Yasuo Three.js Meme Simulator Product Requirements Document (PRD)" focusing on "Foundational Scene & Character Rendering".

**Goal:** To establish a visible, interactive character in a basic world, setting the stage for all subsequent features.

**Story 1.1:** As a user, I want to see a basic 3D environment so that the character has a world to exist in.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. A flat plane is rendered as the ground.
  2. Basic ambient and directional lighting is present to make the scene visible.

**Story 1.2:** As a user, I want to see the "Yasuo in a wheelchair" 3D model rendered in the environment so that the main character of the experience is present.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. The specified 3D model is loaded into the scene.
  2. The model is placed at the center of the ground plane.
  3. The model is correctly scaled and textured.
