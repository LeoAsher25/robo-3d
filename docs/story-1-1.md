**Epic:** Epic 1: Foundational Scene & Character Rendering

**Story:** As a user, I want to see a basic 3D environment so that the character has a world to exist in.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. A flat plane is rendered as the ground.
2. Basic ambient and directional lighting is present to make the scene visible.
